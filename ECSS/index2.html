        <h3>Premiere</h3>
        <p>
            Iron Man's earliest stories were published in the monster-themed anthology series Tales 
            of Suspense. Marvel premiered several superheroes this way in the 1960s as superhero 
            comics became more popular than traditional science-fiction and horror comics.
             Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron Man is Born!", appeared in Tales of Suspense #39,
              released in December 1962 with a March 1963 cover date.

        <h3>Solo Series</h3>
        <p>
            I don't feel Tony Stark is a dinosaur, a creature unable to change before 
            the weight of time crushes him aside. Yeah, it is hard in 1977 to praise a
             millionaire industrialist, playboy and former munitions-manufacturer—but 
             it isn't impossible to change that image. Which is what I plan to do.

        <h2>Personality and motivations</h2>
        <p>
            Iron Man is a businessman and entrepreneur who seeks to innovate and improve his technology,
            both for society's benefit and his own.Iron Man is one of many Marvel heroes with a genius-level 
            intellect,[106] but his focus on societal application alongside hard science distinguishes him
             from other heroes.[106] The character is a futurist, and he works to identify solutions for 
             problems that have yet to emerge. This preemptive problem-solving was a driving force in his 
             organization of the Avengers and later in his support for the Superhero Registration
              Act during the Civil War event.
